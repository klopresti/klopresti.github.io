I’m a Portland-based technical communications professional with a passion for creating clear, user-friendly documentation. With years of experience in managing and delivering technical content, I thrive when I'm helping users understand and navigate complex systems. Whether I’m mentoring teams on DITA XML best practices or streamlining content workflows, I bring a thoughtful, collaborative approach to every challenge.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me biking through Portland’s vibrant neighborhoods or along scenic trails—I love the city’s bike-friendly culture. Post-pandemic, I’m also rediscovering my love for travel. Recent trips have led me to meet up with friends in Honolulu, San Diego, and Chicago. When I’m not on my bike or tackling a new project, I enjoy relaxing with a quirky fictional murder mystery show like Brokenwood Mysteries or a good book. I’m curious, creative, and always eager to explore new horizons—whether in my work or in life.
