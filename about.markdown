I’m a Portland-based technical communications professional with a passion for creating clear, user-friendly documentation. With years of experience in managing and delivering technical content, I thrive when I'm helping users understand and navigate complex systems. Whether I’m mentoring teams on DITA XML best practices or streamlining content workflows, I bring a thoughtful, collaborative approach to every challenge.

Outside of work, you’ll often find me biking through Portland’s vibrant neighborhoods or along scenic trails—I love the city’s bike-friendly culture. Post-pandemic, I’m also rediscovering my love for travel. Recent trips have led me to meet up with friends in Honolulu, San Diego, and Chicago. 

I’m curious, creative, and always eager to explore new horizons—whether in my work or in life.
