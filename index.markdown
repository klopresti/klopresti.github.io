I am a skilled technical communicator dedicated to creating clear, reusable, and high-quality documentation. This site showcases my experience with both writing content and publishing output.

I enjoy refining documentation workflows, configuring publishing pipelines, and mentoring others in DITA-XML best practices. And I'm passionate about leveraging tools like Oxygen XML Editor, DITA-OT, and CI/CD systems to enhance documentation quality and efficiency.
