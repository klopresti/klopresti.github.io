My GitHub profile showcases projects in structured content management and using the DITA Open Toolkit to process DITA content and convert it to other formats. Here's an overview of some notable repositories:

## [com.company2.4.4.pdf](https://github.com/klopresti/com.company2.4.4.pdf) 
A PDF plugin designed for use with DITA Open Toolkit version 2.4.4. Using XSL-FO (Extensible Stylesheet Language Formatting Objects), I adapted the layout and design of the PDF to match an organization's branding guidelines.

schematron.library
This repository includes Schematron rules used to validate patterns in DITA content. It underscores your commitment to maintaining content quality and consistency through automated validation processes.
