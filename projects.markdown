My GitHub profile showcases projects in structured content management and using the DITA Open Toolkit to process DITA content and convert it to other formats. Here's an overview of some notable repositories:

## [com.company2.4.4.pdf](https://github.com/klopresti/com.company2.4.4.pdf) 
I created this PDF plugin for the DITA Open Toolkit to customized the output to meet corporate marketing guidelines. This included creating XSL-FO stylesheets to apply branded fonts, colors, and layouts. My technical publications team used the plug to produce polished PDF deliverables that aligned with our marketing department's expectations and ensured consistency across all customer-facing documentation.

## [schematron.library](https://github.com/klopresti/schematron.library)
This repository stores Schematron rules used to validate patterns in DITA content. For example, one rule flags image elements when they do not use the recommended file format .png. Another rule reminds writers to avoid self-referencing phrases like "this section" in favor of more specific language. The team used these rules to maintain content quality and consistency.
