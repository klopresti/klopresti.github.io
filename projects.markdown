My GitHub profile showcases projects in structured content management and using the DITA Open Toolkit to process DITA content and convert it to other formats. Here are few highlights:

## [PDF plugin com.company.pdf](https://github.com/klopresti/com.company2.4.4.pdf) 
Transformation files used to generate PDF output that adhere to marketing brand guidelines. The technical publications team used the plugin to produce deliverables that were formatted consistently across all products and content types.

The DITA Open Toolkit provided initial PDF output.

![Custom PDF plugin](assets/images/plugin_custom.png)
I added XSL-FO stylesheets to update the page layout and add the company color palette and recommended fonts. 

## [schematron.library](https://github.com/klopresti/schematron.library)
This repository stores Schematron rules used to validate patterns in DITA content. 

![schematron example for image file type](assets/images/schematron_image.png)
This rule flags image elements when they do not use the recommended .png file format. 

![schematron example for section](assets/images/schematron_section.png)
This rule is a reminder to avoid self-referencing phrases such as "this section" in favor of more specific language. The team used these rules to maintain content quality and consistency.
